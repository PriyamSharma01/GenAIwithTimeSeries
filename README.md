Project Description: 
    Develop and deploy a generative AI solution to identify pricing trends, forecast data for 7 days/14 days, and recommend prices for products on E-commerce stores like Amazon/Flipkart. Need the Deployed APIs as part of the submission along with Github link of the Django deployment code.


Goal: 
    The goal is to increase profitability by dynamically adjusting prices based on various factors such as customer demographics, competitor pricing, and seasonality.


Dataset: 
    Any price data available on the internet for products in ecommerce stores. Priority for Amazon data.


Tech requirement:
    1.You will design and develop generative AI models using state-of-the-art techniques such as GPT, VAE, and GANs. These models will analyze historical sales data, customer behavior, and market trends to generate optimal pricing strategies.
    
    2.Managing project infrastructure, Creating API using Django and deploying the API in and return the APIs along with data requests.


Additional Information if required:
    • Candidates can use django-restframework for the folder structure.
    • Candidates can deploy the API in Render
    • Candidates can be able to use the latest Huggingface models to train the model using the data.
    • Data can be either scraped or used from any open-source datasets.


Expected outcomes:
    1.Looking for AI models with good predictive performance with accuracy of >80% for Price Optimization, Dynamic price recommendation, Price forecasting for 7 days/14 days/1 quarter, Sales data projection if volume of the data is available.
    
    2.APIs for the below list:
        a.Price Optimization API
        b.Price Recommendation at X date
        c.Price Forecasting API for 7 days/14 days.
        d.Stock projection API.
    
    3.Dataset should be attached along with the submissions above.
